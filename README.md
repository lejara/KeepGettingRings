## How to Run

1. Download [RetroArch Emulator](https://www.retroarch.com/) 1.9.1 
2. Load core with ```Genesis Plus Gx (v1.7.4 a110a05)```
3. Load ROM ```Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (World) (Rev B)```
4. Install dependencies ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run Script ```python SH2_KeepGettingRings.py```
6. Drag the overlay window on top the emulator
7. Have Fun!

Version number of ROM and Core are very important! Since the script targets specific memory addresses in order for it to work!
