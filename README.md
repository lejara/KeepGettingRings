# KeepGettingRings

Makes it so you have to keep getting rings in Sonic The Hedgehog 2. If not the level resets!


How to Run

1. Download [RetroArch Emulator](https://www.retroarch.com/) 1.9.1 
2. Load core with ```Genesis Plus Gx (v1.7.4 a110a05)```
3. Load ROM ```Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (World) (Rev B)```
4. Run Script ```Python SH2_KeepGettingRings.py```
5. Drag the overlay window on top the emulator
6. Have Fun!

Version of ROM and Core is very important! Since the script targets specific memory addresses in order for it to work!
